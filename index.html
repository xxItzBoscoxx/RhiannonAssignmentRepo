      Lulu was found the day before a rainstorm on June 21, 2018 at 4:28pm.
      He previously resided in the bush of an abandoned nursing home.
      He enjoys jumping on keyboards and napping in odd places.
      His favorite snack is Temptations Savory Salmon Flavor.
      Lulu likes to follow me around the house like a dog.
      He is also larger than our chihuahua and likes to pick on our pitbull.
      Catnip is his kryptonite.
      He is the bestest boy!!!
