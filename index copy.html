          <div id="authorDescription">
            <p>"Junji Ito is a Japanese horror mangaka. He was born on 31 July 1963 in Sakashita, now a part of Nakatsugawa, Gifu. Ito began his experience in the horror world at a very young age; his two older sisters would read Kazuo Umezu and Shinichi Koga in magazines, and consequently, he began reading them too. Itō first began writing and drawing manga as a hobby while working as a dental technician in around 1984."
            </p>
            <p>"In addition to Kazuo Umezu, Itō has cited Hideshi Hino, Shinichi Koga, Yasutaka Tsutsui, and H. P. Lovecraft as being major influences on his work. The universe Itō depicts is cruel and capricious; his characters often find themselves victims of malevolent unnatural circumstances for no discernible reason or punished out of proportion for minor infractions against an unknown and incomprehensible natural order. Some of the recurring themes of Itō's work include jealousy, envy, body horror, seemingly ordinary characters who begin to act out of irrational compulsion, the breakdown of society, deep-sea organisms, and the inevitability of one's demise, all displayed through a realistic and simple design, which emphasizes the contrast between beauty and death. The events narrated are unpredictable and violent, and arise from normal situations." </p>
